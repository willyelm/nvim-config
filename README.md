# Nvim config

This is a repository for my personal configuration of nvim including 
colorscheme and plugins

# Dependencies

`nvim-tree` and `lualine` need a patched font for this to work and be configured 
by the terminal client font icons to show up. fonts can be downlaoded from 
https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts. 

I personally use a patched version of the `Hack` font 

[Needs Update] There are other dependencies that need to be documenteed.
